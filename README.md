OASIS Universal Business Language
=================================

UBL is designed to provide a universally understood and recognized commercial syntax for legally binding business documents and to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based  infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. UBL is freely available to everyone without legal encumbrance or licensing fees.

Please refer to the official [open-oasis.org](http://oasis-open.org/) site for the full documentation for [UBL v2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.0/UBL-2.0.html) and [UBL v2.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html)
